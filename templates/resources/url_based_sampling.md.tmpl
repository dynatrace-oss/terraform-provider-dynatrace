  The resource `dynatrace_url_based_sampling` covers configuration for URL-based sampling
---

# dynatrace_url_based_sampling (Resource)

-> This resource requires the API token scopes **Read settings** (`settings.read`) and **Write settings** (`settings.write`)

When Adaptive traffic management is activated, some PurePath distributed traces will be discarded based on your environment licensed limit. With URL-based sampling, you can configure the importance of specific URLs. URLs with higher importance can be treated to be captured more often and vice versa.

## Dynatrace Documentation

- Adaptive traffic management for distributed tracing - https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/observe-and-explore/purepath-distributed-traces/adaptive-traffic-management

- Settings API - https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/environment-api/settings (schemaId: `builtin:url-based-sampling`)

## Export Example Usage

- `terraform-provider-dynatrace -export dynatrace_url_based_sampling` downloads all existing URL-based sampling configuration

The full documentation of the export feature is available [here](https://dt-url.net/h203qmc).
