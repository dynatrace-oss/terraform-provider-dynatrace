  The resource `dynatrace_azure_connection` covers configuration for Azure connections

# dynatrace_azure_connection (Resource)

-> This resource requires the API token scopes **Read settings** (`settings.read`) and **Write settings** (`settings.write`)

-> This resource requires the OAuth scopes **Read settings** (`settings:objects:read`) and **Write settings** (`settings:objects:write`)

## Requirements
This resource can be used to create connections using an Azure client secret or federated identity credential. For the latter case, this resource must be used together with a `dynatrace_azure_connection_authentication` resource.
Ensure you configure both resources together for a valid Azure connection.
An example of how to set up a connection using a client secret or a federated identiy credential can be found in the [Resource Example Usage](#resource-example-usage) section below.

## Limitations
~> **Warning** If a resource is created using an API token or without setting `DYNATRACE_HTTP_OAUTH_PREFERENCE=true` (when both are used), the settings object's owner will remain empty.

An empty owner implies:
- The settings object becomes public, allowing other users with settings permissions to read and modify it.
- Changing the settings object's permissions will have no effect, meaning the `dynatrace_settings_permissions` resource can't alter its access.

When a settings object is created using platform credentials:
- The owner is set to the owner of the OAuth client or platform token.
- By default, the settings object is private; only the owner can read and modify it.
- Access modifiers can be managed using the `dynatrace_settings_permissions` resource.

We recommend using platform credentials to ensure a correct setup.
In case an API token is needed, we recommend setting `DYNATRACE_HTTP_OAUTH_PREFERENCE=true`.
