# dynatrace_credentials (Resource)

~> **Destroy Warning** Credentials **cannot be deleted** if they are still associated with active synthetic monitors.
Terraform will proceed with the destroy operation, but the credential will **not** be removed if any associations remain. **Action Required:** Before destroying this resource, ensure the credential is removed from all associated monitors.
If any monitors remain associated after destroy, you must manually remove those associations and delete the credential manually.

-> This resource requires the API token scopes **Read credential vault entries** (`credentialVault.read`) and **Write credential vault entries** (`credentialVault.write`)
