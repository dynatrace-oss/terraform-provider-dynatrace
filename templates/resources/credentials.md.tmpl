# dynatrace_credentials (Resource)

-> This resource requires the API token scopes **Read credential vault entries** (`credentialVault.read`) and **Write credential vault entries** (`credentialVault.write`)

~> **Note:** A credential vault entry can't be deleted if a synthetic monitor uses it. Therefore, the synthetic monitors are also deleted when the credential vault entry is deleted.
If you want to keep the synthetic monitors, remove the credential vault entry reference from them first.
