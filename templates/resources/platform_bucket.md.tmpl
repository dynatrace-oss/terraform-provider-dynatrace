# dynatrace_platform_bucket (Resource)


## Dynatrace Documentation

- Grail Buckets - https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/platform/grail/data-model#custom-grail-buckets

## Export Example Usage

- `terraform-provider-dynatrace -export dynatrace_platform_bucket` downloads all existing bucket definitions

The full documentation of the export feature is available [here](https://dt-url.net/h203qmc).

## Prerequisites

Using this resource requires an OAuth client to be configured within your account settings.
The scopes of the OAuth Client need to include `View bucket metadata (storage:bucket-definitions:read)`, `Write buckets (storage:bucket-definitions:write)` and `Delete buckets (storage:bucket-definitions:delete)`.

Finally the provider configuration requires the credentials for that OAuth Client.
The configuration section of your provider needs to look like this.
```terraform
provider "dynatrace" {
  dt_env_url   = "https://########.live.dynatrace.com/"  
  dt_api_token = "######.########################.################################################################"  

  # Usually not required. Terraform will deduct it if `dt_env_url` has been specified
  # automation_env_url = "https://########.apps.dynatrace.com/" 
  automation_client_id = "######.########"
  automation_client_secret = "######.########.################################################################"  
}
```
-> In order to handle credentials in a secure manner we recommend to use the environment variables `DYNATRACE_AUTOMATION_CLIENT_ID` and `DYNATRACE_AUTOMATION_CLIENT_SECRET` as an alternative.

## Environment Variables (Optional)

There may be a delay for this resource to be fully available as a dependency for a subsequent resource. E.g. Utilizing this resource and `dynatrace_log_buckets` together.
 
A default polling mechanism exists to validate the creation but may require tweaking due to load. The following environment variables can be used to fine tune these settings.

- `DT_BUCKETS_RETRIES` (Default: 180, Max: 360) configures the maximum attempts to confirm that the operation (create, update or delete) has succeeded and was completed on the server side. There is a two second delay between consecutive attempts, therefore the check completes with at most 720 seconds with the maximum setting.
- `DT_BUCKETS_NUM_SUCCESSES` (Default: 10, Max: 50) configures the number of successful consecutive retries expected, this applies to creating the resource only.
