# dynatrace_network_monitor_outage (Resource)

-> Configuration of the synthetic test scope overlaps with [dynatrace_network_monitor](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace/latest/docs/resources/network_monitor), but this resource in addition provides an option for an environment scope.

-> This resource requires the API token scopes **Read settings** (`settings.read`) and **Write settings** (`settings.write`)
