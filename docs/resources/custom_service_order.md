# dynatrace_custom_service_order (Resource)

-> This resource requires the API token scopes **Read configuration** (`ReadConfig`) and **Write configuration** (`WriteConfig`)

## Dynatrace Documentation

- Define custom services - https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/services/custom-services

- Custom services API - https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/configuration-api/service-api/custom-services-api

## Export Example Usage

- `terraform-provider-dynatrace -export dynatrace_custom_service_order` downloads a resource containing the current order for Custom Services defined in the Dynatrace Environment.

The full documentation of the export feature is available [here](https://dt-url.net/h203qmc).

## Resource Example Usage

The example below contains configuration for two custom services defined for .NET applications and two custom services defined for Java applications.
The resource `dynatrace_custom_service_order` defines what order these naming rules should get evaluated in - separated by technology (.NET / Java).

Specifically for this example:
* Custom Services for .NET and Java defined in the Dynatrace Environment that are not managed by Terraform will end up ranked with lower priority than the ones listed within `dynatrace_custom_service_order`
* The order of Custom Services defined in the Dynatrace Environment for Golang, PHP and NodeJS will remain unaffected

-> Be aware of the fact that the resource `dynatrace_custom_service_order` should be treated as a singleton. Maintaining more than one instances of `dynatrace_custom_service_order` within the same Terraform module is not recommended. It will result in non-empty plans.

```terraform
resource "dynatrace_custom_service_order" "this" {
  dotnet = [
    var.dynatrace_custom_service.dotnet-first.id,
    var.dynatrace_custom_service.dotnet-second.id,
  ]
  java = [
    var.dynatrace_custom_service.java-first.id,
    var.dynatrace_custom_service.java-second.id,
  ]
}

resource "dynatrace_custom_service" "java-first" {
        name = "java-first"
        technology = "java"
        enabled = true
        rule {
        ...
        }
        ...
        queue_entry_point = false
}

resource "dynatrace_custom_service" "java-second" {
        name = "java-second"
        technology = "java"
        enabled = true
        rule {
        ...
        }
        ...
        queue_entry_point = false
}

resource "dynatrace_custom_service" "dotnet-first" {
        name = "dotnet-first"
        technology = "dotNet"
        enabled = true
        rule {
        ...
        }
        ...
        queue_entry_point = false
}

resource "dynatrace_custom_service" "dotnet-second" {
        name = "dotnet-second"
        technology = "dotNet"
        enabled = true
        rule {
        ...
        }
        ...
        queue_entry_point = false
}
