  The resource `dynatrace_mobile_app_enablement` covers configuration for mobile application enablement and cost control
---

# dynatrace_mobile_app_enablement (Resource)

-> Configuration of the application scope overlaps with [dynatrace_mobile_application](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace/latest/docs/resources/mobile_application), but this resource in addition provides an option for an environment scope.

-> This resource requires the API token scopes **Read settings** (`settings.read`) and **Write settings** (`settings.write`)

## Dynatrace Documentation

- Configure cost and traffic control for mobile applications - https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/real-user-monitoring/setup-and-configuration/mobile-applications/configure-cost-and-traffic-control-mobile

- Settings API - https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/environment-api/settings (schemaId: `builtin:rum.mobile.enablement`)

## Export Example Usage

- `terraform-provider-dynatrace -export dynatrace_mobile_app_enablement` downloads all existing mobile application enablement and cost control configuration

The full documentation of the export feature is available [here](https://dt-url.net/h203qmc).

## Resource Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dynatrace_mobile_app_enablement" "#name#" {
  rum {
    enabled                  = true
    cost_and_traffic_control = 25
  }
  session_replay {
    on_crash = false
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `rum` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) (Field has overlap with `dynatrace_mobile_application`) Capture and analyze all user actions within your application. Enable [Real User Monitoring (RUM)](https://dt-url.net/1n2b0prq) to monitor and improve your application's performance, identify errors, and gain insight into your user's behavior and experience. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rum))
- `session_replay` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) (Field has overlap with `dynatrace_mobile_application`) [Session Replay on crashes](https://dt-url.net/session-replay) gives you additional context for crash analysis in the form of video-like screen recordings that replay user actions immediately preceding a detected crash, while providing [best-in-class security and data protection](https://dt-url.net/b303zxj). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--session_replay))

### Optional

- `application_id` (String) The scope of this settings. If the settings should cover the whole environment, just don't specify any scope.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--rum"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rum`

Required:

- `cost_and_traffic_control` (Number) Percentage of user sessions captured and analyzed. By default, Dynatrace captures all user actions and user sessions for analysis. This approach ensures complete insight into your applicationâ€™s performance and customer experience. You can optionally reduce the granularity of user-action and user-session analysis by capturing a lower percentage of user sessions. While this approach can reduce monitoring costs, it also results in lower visibility into how your customers are using your applications. For example, a setting of 10% results in Dynatrace analyzing only every tenth user session.
- `enabled` (Boolean) This setting is enabled (`true`) or disabled (`false`)

Optional:

- `enabled_on_grail` (Boolean) Please be aware that only mobile agents with version **8.303 or higher** can ingest Grail events


<a id="nestedblock--session_replay"></a>
### Nested Schema for `session_replay`

Required:

- `on_crash` (Boolean) Before enabling, Dynatrace checks your system against the [prerequisites for Session Replay](https://dt-url.net/t23s0ppi).
