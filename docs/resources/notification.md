# dynatrace_notification (Resource)

!> This resource API endpoint has been deprecated, please use dynatrace_{notificationtype}_notification instead. 
For example, for email notifications use [dynatrace_email_notification](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace/latest/docs/resources/email_notification).

-> This resource requires the API token scopes **Read configuration** (`ReadConfig`) and **Write configuration** (`WriteConfig`)
