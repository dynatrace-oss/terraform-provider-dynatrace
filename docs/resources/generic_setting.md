  The resource `dynatrace_generic_setting` covers configuration for Schemas contributed by Custom Platform Apps
---

# dynatrace_generic_setting (Resource)

-> This resource requires the API token scopes **Read settings** (`settings.read`) and **Write settings** (`settings.write`)
-> In case the Platform App configured by such a settings explicitly validates them, authentication via API Token may not be enough. In such a case the environment variables `DYNATRACE_AUTOMATION_CLIENT_ID` and `DYNATRACE_AUTOMATION_CLIENT_SECRET` are required. That OAuth Client will require the permissions `app-engine:apps:run` and `settings:objects:write`. In any case, Terraform will primarily attempt to create or modify the settings using the API Token and if that fails will utilize the OAuth Client for authentication.

## Export Example Usage

- `terraform-provider-dynatrace -export dynatrace_generic_setting` downloads all existing settings related to Platform Apps.

The full documentation of the export feature is available [here](https://dt-url.net/h203qmc).

## Resource Example Usage

The actual payload of the configuration is essentially any kind of JSON object assigned to the attribute `value`.
The `scope` attribute is optional and defaults to `environment` - which is usually the case for settings contributed by Platform Apps.
You can best `schema` for the settings of a specific Platform App find when navigating in the WebUI to these settings and click the ellipsis button.

```terraform
resource "dynatrace_generic_setting" "ABC" {
  schema = "app:my.booking.analytics:connection"
  scope  = "environment"
  value = jsonencode({
    "client_id"     : "asdfhh",
    "client_secret" : "mysecret",
    "name"          : "ABC",
    "tenant_id"     : "asdf",
    "type"          : "client_secret",
    "user_id"       : "asdf"
  })
}
```
