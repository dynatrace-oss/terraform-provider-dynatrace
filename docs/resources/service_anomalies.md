# dynatrace_service_anomalies (Resource)

!> This resource is utilizing an older API endpoint, please use [dynatrace_service_anomalies_v2](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace/latest/docs/resources/service_anomalies_v2) instead.

-> This resource requires the API token scopes **Read configuration** (`ReadConfig`) and **Write configuration** (`WriteConfig`)

## Dynatrace Documentation

- Adjust the sensitivity of anomaly detection for services - https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/problem-detection-and-analysis/problem-detection/adjust-sensitivity-anomaly-detection/adjust-sensitivity-services

- Anomaly detection API - Services - https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/configuration-api/anomaly-detection-api/anomaly-detection-api-services

## Export Example Usage

- `terraform-provider-dynatrace -export dynatrace_service_anomalies` downloads all existing service anomaly detection configuration

The full documentation of the export feature is available [here](https://dt-url.net/h203qmc).

## Resource Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dynatrace_service_anomalies" "#name#" {
  failure_rates {
    auto {
      absolute = 0
      relative = 50
    }
  }
  load {
    drops {
      minutes = 1
      percent = 50
    }
    spikes {
      minutes = 1
      percent = 200
    }
  }
  load_drops {
    minutes = 1
    percent = 50
  }
  response_times {
    auto {
      load                 = "TEN_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE"
      milliseconds         = 100
      percent              = 50
      slowest_milliseconds = 1000
      slowest_percent      = 100
    }
  }
}

## Schema

### Optional

- `failure_rates` (Block List, Max: 1) Configuration of failure rate increase detection. Detecting failure rate increases will be disabled if this block is omitted. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--failure_rates))
- `load` (Block List, Max: 1) The configuration of load spikes detection. Detecting load spikes will be disabled if this block is omitted. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--load))
- `load_drops` (Block List, Max: 1) The configuration of load drops detection. Detecting load drops will be disabled if this block is omitted. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--load_drops))
- `response_times` (Block List, Max: 1) Configuration of response time degradation detection. Detecting response time degradation will be disabled if this block is omitted. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--response_times))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--failure_rates"></a>
### Nested Schema for `failure_rates`

Optional:

- `auto` (Block List, Max: 1) Parameters of failure rate increase auto-detection. Example: If the expected error rate is 1.5%, and you set an absolute increase of 1%, and a relative increase of 50%, the thresholds will be:  Absolute: 1.5% + **1%** = 2.5%  Relative: 1.5% + 1.5% * **50%** = 2.25% (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--failure_rates--auto))
- `thresholds` (Block List, Max: 1) Fixed thresholds for failure rate increase detection (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--failure_rates--thresholds))

<a id="nestedblock--failure_rates--auto"></a>
### Nested Schema for `failure_rates.auto`

Required:

- `absolute` (Number) Absolute increase of failing service calls to trigger an alert, %
- `relative` (Number) Relative increase of failing service calls to trigger an alert, %

Optional:

- `unknowns` (String) allows for configuring properties that are not explicitly supported by the current version of this provider


<a id="nestedblock--failure_rates--thresholds"></a>
### Nested Schema for `failure_rates.thresholds`

Required:

- `sensitivity` (String) Sensitivity of the threshold.  With `low` sensitivity, high statistical confidence is used. Brief violations (for example, due to a surge in load) won't trigger alerts.  With `high` sensitivity, no statistical confidence is used. Each violation triggers alert
- `threshold` (Number) Failure rate during any 5-minute period to trigger an alert, %

Optional:

- `unknowns` (String) allows for configuring properties that are not explicitly supported by the current version of this provider



<a id="nestedblock--load"></a>
### Nested Schema for `load`

Optional:

- `drops` (Block List, Max: 1) The configuration of traffic drops detection (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--load--drops))
- `spikes` (Block List, Max: 1) The configuration of traffic spikes detection (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--load--spikes))

<a id="nestedblock--load--drops"></a>
### Nested Schema for `load.drops`

Optional:

- `minutes` (Number) Alert if the service stays in abnormal state for at least *X* minutes
- `percent` (Number) Alert if the observed load is more than *X* % of the expected value


<a id="nestedblock--load--spikes"></a>
### Nested Schema for `load.spikes`

Optional:

- `minutes` (Number) Alert if the service stays in abnormal state for at least *X* minutes
- `percent` (Number) Alert if the observed load is more than *X* % of the expected value
- `unknowns` (String) allows for configuring properties that are not explicitly supported by the current version of this provider



<a id="nestedblock--load_drops"></a>
### Nested Schema for `load_drops`

Optional:

- `minutes` (Number) Alert if the service stays in abnormal state for at least *X* minutes
- `percent` (Number) Alert if the observed load is more than *X* % of the expected value


<a id="nestedblock--response_times"></a>
### Nested Schema for `response_times`

Optional:

- `auto` (Block List, Max: 1) Parameters of the response time degradation auto-detection. Violation of **any** criterion triggers an alert (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--response_times--auto))
- `thresholds` (Block List, Max: 1) Fixed thresholds for response time degradation detection (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--response_times--thresholds))

<a id="nestedblock--response_times--auto"></a>
### Nested Schema for `response_times.auto`

Required:

- `load` (String) Minimal service load to detect response time degradation. Response time degradation of services with smaller load won't trigger alerts. Possible values are `FIFTEEN_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`, `FIVE_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`, `ONE_REQUEST_PER_MINUTE` and `TEN_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`
- `milliseconds` (Number) Alert if the response time degrades by more than *X* milliseconds

- `slowest_milliseconds` (Number) Alert if the response time of the slowest 10% degrades by more than *X* milliseconds
- `slowest_percent` (Number) Alert if the response time of the slowest 10% degrades by more than *X* milliseconds

Optional:

- `unknowns` (String) allows for configuring properties that are not explicitly supported by the current version of this provider
