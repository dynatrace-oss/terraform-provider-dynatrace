## Schema

### Required

- `active` (Boolean) The monitoring is enabled (`true`) or disabled (`false`).  If not set on creation, the `true` value is used.  If the field is omitted during an update, the old value remains unaffected
- `monitor_only_tagged_entities` (Boolean) Monitor only resources that have specified Azure tags (`true`) or all resources (`false`).

### Optional

- `app_id` (String) The Application ID (also referred to as Client ID)  The combination of Application ID and Directory ID must be unique
- `auto_tagging` (Boolean) The automatic capture of Azure tags is on (`true`) or off (`false`)
- `directory_id` (String) The Directory ID (also referred to as Tenant ID)  The combination of Application ID and Directory ID must be unique
- `key` (String, Sensitive) The secret key associated with the Application ID.  For security reasons, GET requests return this field as `null`. Submit your key on creation or update of the configuration. If the field is omitted during an update, the old value remains unaffected.
- `label` (String) The unique name of the Azure credentials configuration.  Allowed characters are letters, numbers, and spaces. Also the special characters `.+-_` are allowed
- `monitor_only_excluding_tag_pairs` (Block List, Max: 20) A list of Azure tags to be excluded from monitoring.  You can specify up to 20 tags. A resource tagged with *any* of the specified tags is monitored.  Only applicable when the **monitorOnlyTaggedEntities** parameter is set to `true`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--monitor_only_excluding_tag_pairs))
- `monitor_only_tag_pairs` (Block List, Max: 20) A list of Azure tags to be monitored.  You can specify up to 20 tags. A resource tagged with *any* of the specified tags is monitored.  Only applicable when the **monitorOnlyTaggedEntities** parameter is set to `true` (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--monitor_only_tag_pairs))
- `remove_defaults` (Boolean) Instructs the provider to remove the supporting services Dynatrace applies by default to newly created Azure Credentials. Supporting Services applied by via `dynatrace_azure_service` subsequently won't get touched.
- `supporting_services` (Block List, Deprecated) A list of Azure supporting services to be monitored. For each service there's a sublist of its metrics and the metrics' dimensions that should be monitored. All of these elements (services, metrics, dimensions) must have corresponding static definitions on the server. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--supporting_services))
- `supporting_services_managed_in_dynatrace` (Boolean, Deprecated) If enabled (`true`) the attribute `supporting_services` will not get synchronized with Dynatrace. You will be able to manage them via WebUI without interference by Terraform.
- `unknowns` (String) Any attributes that aren't yet supported by this provider
