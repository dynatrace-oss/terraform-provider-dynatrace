# dynatrace_aws_service (Resource)

-> This resource is excluded by default in the export utility.

## Dynatrace Documentation

- Amazon Web Services - https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/setup-and-configuration/setup-on-cloud-platforms/amazon-web-services/amazon-web-services-integrations/aws-service-metrics

- AWS credentials API - https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/configuration-api/aws-credentials-api

## Resource Example Usage

This example utilizes the data source `dynatrace_aws_supported_services` in order to query for a full list of all supported services.
The `for_each` loop within the resource `dynatrace_aws_service` configures each of these services to get utilized with the default metrics recommended by Dynatrace (`use_recommended_metrics`).

If you want to configure a different set of metrics for a specific service, a separate resource `dynatrace_aws_service` will be necessary for that. That allows you to configure the `metric` blocks according to your wishes.
Just be aware of the fact, that Dynatrace enforces for most services a recommended set of metrics. All of them need to be part of your configuration in order to end up with a non-empty plan.

```terraform
resource "dynatrace_aws_credentials" "TERRAFORM_SAMPLE" {
  label          = "TERRAFORM-TEST-001"
  partition_type = "AWS_DEFAULT"
  tagged_only    = false
  authentication_data {
    account_id = "246186168471"
    iam_role   = "Dynatrace_monitoring_role_demo1"
  }
}

data "dynatrace_aws_supported_services" "supported_services" {    
}

resource "dynatrace_aws_service" "TERRAFORM_SAMPLE_services" {
  for_each = data.dynatrace_aws_supported_services.supported_services.services
  credentials_id = dynatrace_aws_credentials.TERRAFORM_SAMPLE.id
  use_recommended_metrics = true
  name           = each.key
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `credentials_id` (String) the ID of the AWS credentials this supported service belongs to

### Optional

- `metric` (Block Set) A list of metrics to be monitored for this service. Depending on the service Dynatrace insists on a set of recommended metrics to be configured for that service. If any of these recommended metrics is missing here, the Terraform Provider will automatically add them during `terraform apply`. This usually results in a non-empty plan, until all of the recommended metrics are present within your configuration. For services considered `built-in` by Dynatrace any metrics specified here will be ignored - Dynatrace enforces a fixed set of metrics for these services. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--metric))
- `name` (String) The name of the supporting service.
- `use_recommended_metrics` (Boolean) If `true` Terraform will negotiate with the Dynatrace API about the recommended/enforced metrics to be applied. Any `metric` specified will be therefore ignored.

### Read-Only

- `built_in` (Boolean) This attribute is automatically set to `true` if Dynatrace considers the supporting service with the given name to be a built-in service
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `required_metrics` (String) Used internally by the Terraform Provider in order to remember the metrics enforced by Dynatrace

### Nested Schema for `metric`

Required:

- `name` (String) the name of the metric of the supporting service

Optional:

- `dimensions` (Set of String) a list of metric's dimensions names
- `statistic` (String) Possible values are `AVERAGE`, `AVG_MIN_MAX`, `MAXIMUM`, `MINIMUM`, `SAMPLE_COUNT` and `SUM`
