## Schema

### Required

- `auto_injection` (Boolean) An auto-injection disabled with [oneagentctl](https://dt-url.net/oneagentctl) takes precedence over this setting and cannot be changed from the Dynatrace web UI.
- `enabled` (Boolean) This setting is enabled (`true`) or disabled (`false`)
- `full_stack` (Boolean) Dynatrace uses full-stack monitoring by default, to monitor every aspect of your environment, including all processes, services, and applications detected on your hosts. 

If you turn off full-stack monitoring, Dynatrace will only monitor your infrastructure. You will lose access to application performance, user experience data, code-level visibility and PurePath insights. 

To learn more, visit [Infrastructure Monitoring mode](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/infrastructure).

Please note that changing the monitoring mode will impact the license consumption of this OneAgent. To learn more, visit [Host units](https://dt-url.net/hi03uns).
- `host_id` (String) The scope of this settings. If the settings should cover the whole environment, just don't specify any scope.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
