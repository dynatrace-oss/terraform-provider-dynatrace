  The resource `dynatrace_custom_app_enablement` covers configuration for custom application enablement and cost control
---

# dynatrace_custom_app_enablement (Resource)

-> Configuration of the application scope overlaps with [dynatrace_mobile_application](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace/latest/docs/resources/mobile_application), but this resource in addition provides an option for an environment scope.

-> This resource requires the API token scopes **Read settings** (`settings.read`) and **Write settings** (`settings.write`)

## Dynatrace Documentation

- Configure cost and traffic control for custom applications - https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/real-user-monitoring/setup-and-configuration/custom-applications/configure-cost-and-traffic-control-custom

- Settings API - https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/environment-api/settings (schemaId: `builtin:rum.custom.enablement`)

## Export Example Usage

- `terraform-provider-dynatrace -export dynatrace_custom_app_enablement` downloads all existing custom application enablement and cost control configuration

The full documentation of the export feature is available [here](https://dt-url.net/h203qmc).

## Resource Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dynatrace_custom_app_enablement" "#name#" {
  scope = "environment"
  rum {
    enabled                  = false
    cost_and_traffic_control = 40
  }

## Schema

### Required

- `rum` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) Capture and analyze all user actions within your application. Enable [Real User Monitoring (RUM)](https://dt-url.net/1n2b0prq) to monitor and improve your application's performance, identify errors, and gain insight into your user's behavior and experience. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rum))

### Optional

- `scope` (String) The scope of this setting (CUSTOM_APPLICATION). Omit this property if you want to cover the whole environment.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--rum"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rum`

Required:

- `cost_and_traffic_control` (Number) (Field has overlap with `dynatrace_mobile_application`) Percentage of user sessions captured and analyzed. By default, Dynatrace captures all user actions and user sessions for analysis. This approach ensures complete insight into your applicationâ€™s performance and customer experience. You can optionally reduce the granularity of user-action and user-session analysis by capturing a lower percentage of user sessions. While this approach can reduce monitoring costs, it also results in lower visibility into how your customers are using your applications. For example, a setting of 10% results in Dynatrace analyzing only every tenth user session.
- `enabled` (Boolean) This setting is enabled (`true`) or disabled (`false`)
