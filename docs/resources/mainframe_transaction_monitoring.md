## Schema

### Required

- `group_cics_regions` (Boolean) If enabled, CICS regions belonging to the same CICSPlex will be grouped into a single process group. If disabled, a process group will be created for each CICS region.
- `group_ims_regions` (Boolean) If enabled, IMS regions belonging to the same subsystem will be grouped into a single process group. If disabled, a process group will be created for each IMS region.
- `monitor_all_ctg_protocols` (Boolean) If enabled, the CICS Transaction Gateway sensor will trace all EXCI requests including those that are using the TCP/IP or SNA protocol.
- `monitor_all_incoming_web_requests` (Boolean) Dynatrace automatically traces incoming web requests when they are called by already-monitored services. Enable this setting to monitor all incoming web requests. We recommend enabling it only over a short period of time.
- `node_limit` (Number) We recommend the default limit of 500 nodes. The value 0 means unlimited number of nodes.
- `zos_cics_service_detection_uses_transaction_id` (Boolean) If enabled, a CICS service will be created for each monitored transaction ID within a process group. If disabled, a CICS service will be created for each monitored CICS region within a process group. We recommend enabling it only when the CICS regions are grouped by their CICSPlex.
- `zos_ims_service_detection_uses_transaction_id` (Boolean) If enabled, an IMS service will be created for each monitored transaction ID within a process group. If disabled, an IMS service will be created for each monitored IMS region within a process group. We recommend enabling it only when the IMS regions are grouped by their subsystem.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
