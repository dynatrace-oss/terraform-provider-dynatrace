# dynatrace_custom_anomalies (Resource)

!> This resource API endpoint has been deprecated, please use [dynatrace_metric_events](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace/latest/docs/resources/metric_events) instead.

-> This resource requires the API token scopes **Read configuration** (`ReadConfig`) and **Write configuration** (`WriteConfig`)

## Dynatrace Documentation

- Metric events for alerting - https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/how-to-use-dynatrace/problem-detection-and-analysis/problem-detection/metric-events-for-alerting

- Anomaly detection API - Metric events - https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/configuration-api/anomaly-detection-api/anomaly-detection-api-metric-events

## Export Example Usage

- `terraform-provider-dynatrace -export dynatrace_custom_anomalies` downloads all existing custom metric event configuration

The full documentation of the export feature is available [here](https://dt-url.net/h203qmc).

## Resource Example Usage

```terraform
resource "dynatrace_custom_anomalies" "#name#" {
  name                  = "#name#"
  description           = "The {metricname} value of {severity} was {alert_condition} the baseline of {baseline}."
  metric_selector       = "ghputoutgoing:filter(existsKey(\"dt.entity.service\"),in(\"dt.entity.service\",entitySelector(\"type(SERVICE),mzId(6734823652592292763)\"))):avg"
  enabled               = true
  primary_dimension_key = "dt.entity.service"
  severity              = "PERFORMANCE"
  warning_reason        = "NONE"

## Schema

### Required

- `description` (String) The description of the metric event
- `enabled` (Boolean) The metric event is enabled (`true`) or disabled (`false`)
- `name` (String) The name of the metric event displayed in the UI
- `strategy` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) A monitoring strategy for a metric event config. This is the base version of the monitoring strategy, depending on the type,  the actual JSON may contain additional fields (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--strategy))

### Optional

- `aggregation_type` (String) How the metric data points are aggregated for the evaluation. The timeseries must support this aggregation
- `dimensions` (Block List) Defines the dimensions of the metric to alert on. The filters are combined by conjunction (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--dimensions))
- `disabled_reason` (String, Deprecated) The reason of automatic disabling.  The `NONE` means config was not disabled automatically. Possible values are `METRIC_DEFINITION_INCONSISTENCY`, `NONE`, `TOO_MANY_DIMS` and `TOPX_FORCIBLY_DEACTIVATED`
- `metric_id` (String) The ID of the metric evaluated by the metric event
- `metric_selector` (String) The metric selector that should be executed
- `primary_dimension_key` (String) Defines which dimension key should be used for the **alertingScope**
- `scopes` (Block List) Defines the scope of the metric event. Only one filter is allowed per filter type, except for tags, where up to 3 are allowed. The filters are combined by conjunction (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--scopes))
- `severity` (String) The type of the event to trigger on the threshold violation.  The `CUSTOM_ALERT` type is not correlated with other alerts. The `INFO` type does not open a problem
- `unknowns` (String) allows for configuring properties that are not explicitly supported by the current version of this provider
- `warning_reason` (String, Deprecated) The reason of a warning set on the config. The `NONE` means config has no warnings. The other supported value is `TOO_MANY_DIMS`

### Read-Only

### Nested Schema for `strategy`

Optional:

An example is to detect an anomaly in the number of received network packets or within the number of user actions over time (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--strategy--auto))
- `generic` (Block List) A generic monitoring strategy (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--strategy--generic))
- `static` (Block List, Max: 1) A static threshold monitoring strategy to alert on hard limits within a given metric. An example is the violation of a critical memory limit (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--strategy--static))
