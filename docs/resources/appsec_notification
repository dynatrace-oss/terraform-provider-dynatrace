# dynatrace_appsec_notification (Resource)

-> This resource is excluded by default in the export utility since it requires the feature to be activated, please explicitly specify the resource to retrieve existing configuration.

-> This resource requires the API token scopes **Read security problems** (`securityProblems.read`) and **Write security problems** (`securityProblems.write`)

## Dynatrace Documentation

- Security notifications for vulnerabilities and attacks - https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/platform-modules/application-security/security-notifications

- Settings API - https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/environment-api/settings (schemaId: `builtin:appsec.notification-integration`)

## Export Example Usage

- `terraform-provider-dynatrace -export dynatrace_appsec_notification` downloads all existing security notifications
