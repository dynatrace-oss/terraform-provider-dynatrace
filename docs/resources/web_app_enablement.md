  The resource `dynatrace_web_app_enablement` covers configuration for web application enablement and cost control
---

# dynatrace_web_app_enablement (Resource)

-> Configuration of the application scope overlaps with [dynatrace_web_application](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dynatrace-oss/dynatrace/latest/docs/resources/web_application), but this resource in addition provides an option for an environment scope.

-> This resource requires the API token scopes **Read settings** (`settings.read`) and **Write settings** (`settings.write`)

- `rum` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) Capture and analyze all user actions within your application. Enable [Real User Monitoring (RUM)](https://dt-url.net/1n2b0prq) to monitor and improve your application's performance, identify errors, and gain insight into your user's behavior and experience. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rum))
- `session_replay` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) [Session Replay](https://dt-url.net/session-replay) captures all user interactions within your application and replays them in a movie-like experience while providing [best-in-class security and data protection](https://dt-url.net/b303zxj). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--session_replay))

### Optional

- `application_id` (String) The scope of this settings. If the settings should cover the whole environment, just don't specify any scope.
- `experience_analytics` (Block List, Max: 1) Experience Analytics (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--experience_analytics))
