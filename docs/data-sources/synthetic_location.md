-> For Provider versions v1.80.0 and newer: This data source requires the API token scope **Read synthetic locations** (`syntheticLocations.read`)

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "dynatrace_synthetic_location" "Test" {
  cloud_platform = "AMAZON_EC2"
  type           = "PUBLIC"
  name           = "Sydney"
}

resource "dynatrace_http_monitor" "#name#" {
  name = "#name#" 
  enabled = true 
  frequency = 60 
  locations = ["${data.dynatrace_synthetic_location.Test.id}"] 
  anomaly_detection {
    loading_time_thresholds {
      enabled = true 
    }
    outage_handling {
      global_outage = true 
      local_outage = false 
      retry_on_error = false 
    }
  }
  script {
    request {
      description = "google.com" 
      method = "GET" 
      url = "https://www.google.com" 
      configuration {
        accept_any_certificate = true 
        follow_redirects = true 
      }
      validation {
        rule {
          type = "httpStatusesList" 
          pass_if_found = false 
          value = "\u003e=400"
