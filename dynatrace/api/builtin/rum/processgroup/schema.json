For example, consider an Apache HTTP server as a proxy and a Java app server as a backend. Disabling this setting for the process group of the Apache HTTP server will break the RUM correlation, even if Dynatrace injects the RUM JavaScript tag on the process group of the Java backend. For RUM data to correlate with server-side PurePaths, RUM must be enabled on the OneAgent that instruments the entry point of your application (the Apache HTTP server in this example).",
